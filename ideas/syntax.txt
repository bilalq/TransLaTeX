Ideas for the syntax I want to use
==================================

General Ideas:
- Interprets as math by default. Text inside "quotes" will be interpreted as
  a string.
- For now, alignment will be either center, left, or right.
  Possibly use a config.yml file to customize template settings

Syntax:
  Syntax Element                  Syntax Style
  ==============                  ============
  Operators:                      + - * / > < >= <= = != ( ) [ ] { } |
  Escape character:               \
  Square roots:                   sqrt(...)
  Superscripts:                   normal^(super)
  Subscripts:                     normal_(sub)
  Sums:                           sum(i=1 -> n, ...)
  Limits:                         lim(x -> inf, ...)
  Fractions:                      frac(numerator, denominator)

  Greek Letters/Quantifiers/Symbols
  (Use capital letter for beginning to get upper case version of the letter)
  Reference by
  ============
  $pi
  $theta
  $sigma
  $epsilon
  $nu
  $exists
  $forall
  $not
  $in
  $notin
  etc...

FORGET ALL THE ABOVE.

KEEP CALM AND USE LISP.
